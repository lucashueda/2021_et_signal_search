# SETI Breakthrough Listen - E.T. Signal Search (2021)

Repository for ET Signal Search (2021) kaggle competition.

Funny competitions that i'm using to learn and get better in deep learning. My focus is in building a good EDA, a stable model and appliable. Feel free to use as code reference, my intention is to create a good and well explained repository, explaining all steps, since EDA's, specifics tests, auxiliary codes and how to train, evaluate and apply the models.

# Repository structure

- src: all codes
- bin: application codes (train, eval, testing)
- tests: previous pipelines used in test steps
- notebooks: Notebooks used while building the repository (can be ignored, if any file is important it will be recerenced in README)
- examples: Examples of some concepts, used to store new knowledge aquired, can be useful for someone who is learning about this topic
